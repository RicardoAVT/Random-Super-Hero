This project is a random super hero generator were I used the content fetched from https://superheroapi.com/.
I implemented the option to fetch a random duper hero from the api or to search a super hero by its name and get its information if it exists.

With this project my main goal was to start getting more comfortable manipulating the DOM, using APIs and to practice htlm and css layout.
