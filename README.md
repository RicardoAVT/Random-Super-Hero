This project is a random super hero generator were I used the content fetched from https://superheroapi.com/.
I implemented the option to fetch a random super hero from the api or to search a super hero by its name and get its information if it exists.

With this project my main goal was to start getting more comfortable manipulating the <b>DOM</b>, using <b>APIs</b> and to practice <b>htlm and css layout</b>.
